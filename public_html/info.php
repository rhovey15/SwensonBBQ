<h1>Company Information!</h1>

<article> We were created in 2002 when a family friend of ours found out that he was gluten intolerant. He was very sad that he could no longer enjoy his BBQ meat with BBQ sauce because all of the sauces contained gluten!  This got us started in making our own recipe for our friends to enjoy and everyone else! We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
